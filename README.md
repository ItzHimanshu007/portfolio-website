# Portfolio Website — Himanshu 007  
*A sleek, modern personal portfolio built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS*

The site is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. It’s optimized for performance, mobile responsiveness, and deploys for free via GitHub Pages / Vercel.

- Home / Hero section with introduction  
- About me section (skills, background, interests)  
- Projects section highlighting significant work  
- Contact section (email link / social profiles)

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Local Development)  
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzHimanshu007/portfolio-website.git
   cd portfolio-website
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Build for production:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
npm run start
Or export as a static site:

bash
npm run export
🔧 Customisation
Update your name, bio, social links in pages/index.jsx (or wherever you placed them).

Add, edit or remove project entries in the projects array inside pages/index.jsx (or a dedicated data file).

Modify styles via tailwind.config.cjs and styles/globals.css for colour scheme, fonts, etc.

For full static export (to host on GitHub Pages), ensure next.config.js has proper basePath / assetPrefix if needed.

📦 Deployment
This site is ready to be deployed for free:

GitHub Pages: If exporting statically (npm run export), push the out/ folder to the gh-pages branch and configure via repository settings.

Vercel: Connect the GitHub repo, and Vercel will auto-deploy on each push.

Netlify: Also possible — set the build command to npm run build && npm run export and publish the output folder.
